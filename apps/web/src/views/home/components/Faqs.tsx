    question: "Why make an open source Trello?",
    answer: (
      <Text>
        When Trello launched in 2011, it blew everyone away with its carefully
        designed simplicity, but over time (and atlassification) it lost its
        magic and grew into something closer to "Jira Lite". This project is our
        attempt to recapture the original magic of Trelloâ€™s simplicity, in open
        source.

    question: "What's the difference between Kan and Trello?",
    answer: (
      <Text>
        The main difference between Kan and Trello is that Kan is open source,
        allowing anyone to view, modify, and contribute to our code. Our cloud
        offering also offers no restrictions on features for individual use,
        whereas Trello locks basic features such as the number of boards you can
        create behind a paywall.

    ),
  },
  {
    question: "How is the project funded?",
    answer: (
      <Text>
        For long-term sustainability, we recognise all good open source projects
        need a source of revenue. Ours comes from the paid cloud offering for
        workspaces with multiple users (free during the beta) and for custom
        workspace slugs. There's no obligation to use it, and you can self-host
        the software on your own infrastructure free of charge.
