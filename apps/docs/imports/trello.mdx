## Getting your Trello API key and token

Before you can import your Trello boards, you need to get your Trello API key and token. Follow these steps (only takes a couple of minutes):

1. **Sign in to your Trello account**  
   Go to [https://trello.com](https://trello.com) and log in with your Trello account.

2. **Create a new integration**  
   Visit [https://trello.com/power-ups/admin](https://trello.com/power-ups/admin). Click **Create new** and fill in the following details:

   - **Name**: Choose a name for your integration (e.g. "Kan Import")
   - **Workspace**: Select the workspace containing the boards you want to import
   - **Email**: Enter your email address
   - **Support email**: Enter your email address
   - **Author**: Add your name

3. **Get a Trello API Key**  
   Now click **Generate a new API key** to create an API key.

4. **Generate a Trello Token**  
   On the same page (to the right of the API key), click the link to **generate a Token**. Approve the permissions and copy your token (make sure to save it somewhere secure like a password manager).

## Importing your Trello boards

Once you have your API key and token, importing your Trello boards is easy. Follow these steps:

1. **Create a new import in Kan**  
   Navigate to **[https://kan.bn/boards](https://kan.dev/boards)** and click **Import**.

2. **Select Trello as the Import Source**  
   Choose **Trello** from the list of import options and click **Select source**.

3. **Enter Your Trello API Key and Token**  
   Paste your API key and token into the provided fields and click **Fetch boards** (don't worry, we don't store your key or token).

4. **Start the Import**  
   Select the board you want to import and click **Import boards**. Once the import is complete, you'll see your boards in Kan.
